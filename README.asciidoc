GNU source-highlight Vim lang
-------------------------------

I use the asciidoc blogger backend. It relies on html4 output which
seems to be incompatible with pygments. GNU source-highlight works
though, and all it needed was a syntax file for Vim. This tiny repo
provides that.

It seems that the installation of custom syntax files in GNU
source-highlight is a bit archaic. I couldn't find a simple
solution, at any rate.

.My current hack approach is:

1. ++sudo ln -s /path/to/vim.lang /usr/share/source-highlight/vim.lang++
2. ++sudo sh -c "cat lang.map >> /usr/share/source-highlight/lang.map"++

NOTE: Remember to use `>>` and not `>` in the second command.

If you know of a better way to do this, please let me know.
